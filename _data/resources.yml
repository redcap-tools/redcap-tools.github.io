  description: REDCap-Tools is a GitHub organization that fosters interesting projects built against REDCap. Developers and projects in this organization have no official ties to REDCap other than looking to push the data management capabilities provided by REDCap’s more advanced tools (namely the API and Data Entry Triggers) to their fullest potential.

  description: There are many links in the pipeline between your institution's REDCap server and the API user. When the end result is unsuccessful, this document should help narrow the location of the possible problem. The first two sections will be relevant to almost any language interacting with the API. (Edit source code <a href="https://github.com/OuhscBbmc/REDCapR/blob/master/vignettes/TroubleshootingApiCalls.Rmd">here</a>).
