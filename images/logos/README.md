Potential Logos for redcap-tools Organization
==============================================

These logos were created by importing the ["baseball cap"](http://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/baseball-cap_72588#term=cap&page=1&position=36) icon (from http://www.flaticon.com/) into https://freeiconmaker.com and adding a background and two gradients.  It should be downloadable from https://freeiconmaker.com/template/RKmA_B2D6l6CUR7tFbWuLT7VeaOXknT-lT6JpbbvGi8.

If we end up using one of these for the org's logo, I'll pay the $10 so we don't have to figure out how to include the correct attributes everywhere. (You don't have to include a credit if you pay $10.)

So I don't have to search for the document later, the pricing plans are are http://support.flaticon.com/hc/en-us/articles/202798171-What-are-Flaticon-s-Plans-
